# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîßüíª

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** The outage was like a surprise guest at a party, showing up uninvited on March 24, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM (UTC).
- **Impact:** Our primary web application took an unexpected coffee break, leading to a 30% decrease in user engagement during the incident window.

## Root Cause:
The root cause of the chaos was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. It was like the traffic cop decided to take a nap, causing traffic jams in our web servers' neighborhood.

## Timeline:
- **9:58 AM:** The monitoring systems went berserk, yelling at us about the sudden drop in incoming requests.
- **10:00 AM:** We put on our detective hats and started digging through application server logs and network traffic.
- **10:30 AM:** Initially, we thought our database was throwing a tantrum, so we gave it a stern talking-to.
- **11:00 AM:** After realizing the database was innocent, we turned our attention to the load balancer configurations.
- **11:30 AM:** Ah-ha! We found the culprit - a mischievous misconfiguration! We promptly called for backup from the infrastructure team.
- **12:00 PM:** With some swift adjustments to the load balancer settings, traffic resumed its smooth flow, and our servers sighed in relief.
- **1:00 PM:** Service was back in action, and our users rejoiced as they once again surfed the web without a hitch.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
The misconfigured load balancer was like a toddler playing with buttons, causing chaos in our web traffic distribution. To restore peace, we corrected the load balancer settings to evenly distribute the load across all application servers. We also promised the load balancer some extra supervision to keep it out of trouble in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. **Load Balancer Bootcamp:** Implement strict version control and peer reviews for load balancer configurations. We're also considering a "Traffic Jam Prevention 101" course.
   - Task: Enforce version control for load balancer settings.
   - Task: Establish a buddy system for load balancer configuration changes.
2. **Traffic Control Tower:** Enhance monitoring systems with real-time traffic monitoring and automated alerts for load balancer changes. We might even hire a virtual traffic cop!
   - Task: Set up real-time traffic monitoring on the load balancer.
   - Task: Configure automated alerts for load balancer configuration changes.
3. **Infrastructure Check-ups:** Schedule regular audits of web stack components to identify and fix potential troublemakers before they wreak havoc.
   - Task: Conduct quarterly reviews of load balancer configurations.
   - Task: Perform bi-annual stress tests on application servers and load balancers, complete with virtual traffic jams.

## Conclusion:
Though our web stack briefly went on strike, we emerged stronger and wiser from the experience. By implementing these measures, we're building a more resilient system that can weather any storm - even one caused by a mischievous load balancer! Let's keep the web surfing smooth and the servers happy. üöÄüåêüéâ
